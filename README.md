glacieruploader
===============

A simple java command line application for Amazon Glacier

How to run
==========

[Download the package][0] and open a command line. Then run

    java -jar uploader-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar aws.properties PATH_TO_ARCHIVE YOUR_ENDPOINT YOUR_VAULT

If you provide a wrong number of argument, you should get a USAGE message with explanations.
Keep in mind that this is the very first version and it might break in creative ways.

This is not working for me. What should I do?
=============================================

Go to my [Issues page][1] and add a new issue with a nice report about what's failing for you.
Try to provide enough information so I can help you out and fix the error for everyone. It 
might be a good idea to check for existing issues before reporting a new one.

And as always, you can [fork me and fix the error yourself][2]. :-)
